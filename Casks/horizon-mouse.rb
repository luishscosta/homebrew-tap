  caveats <<~EOS
    Horizon Mouse is not notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Before opening it (and after each upgrade), remove the quarantine:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Horizon Mouse.app"
    Or open it, click OK (not "Move to Trash") and use
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.
    Then authorize it under Accessibility to capture the mouse.
